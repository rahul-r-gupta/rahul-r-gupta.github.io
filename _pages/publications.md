["Does Goliath Help David? Anchoring Firm Creation"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9c2c2ltmxiuo25/Goliath.pdf?dl=0)
(*Working Papers 20-17, Center for Economics Studies, U.S. Census Bureau*)

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the role of agglomeration economies on local firm creation after a large firm's geographical expansion (anchor firm). Using hand-collected data linked to employee-employer matched U.S. Census restricted-use microdata, we exploit anchor firms' site selection processes to employ a difference-in-differences approach to compare workers in winning counties to those in counterfactual counties. The arrival of an anchor firm induces worker reallocation towards young firms in industries related by input-output channels by a magnitude of 120 new businesses that account for approximately 2,300 jobs. Incumbent firms experiencing the fastest wage growth due to these shocks shed mid-layer employees who select into or start local young firms in connected and occupationally similar industries. These effects are strongest on workers employed in the most specialized and knowledge-intensive industries. Attracting an anchor firm to a county appears to have limited spillover effects in overall employment that are mainly driven by reorganization of incumbent firms in the anchor's input-output industries that face rising labor costs.
