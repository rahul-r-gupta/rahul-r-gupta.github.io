["Does Goliath Help David? Anchoring Firm Creation"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9c2c2ltmxiuo25/Goliath.pdf?dl=0)
(*NEW DRAFT FORTHCOMING*)

**Abstract:** A major shift in U.S. economic policy is the rise of industrial policies that incentivize target firms to locate in specific locations. We study whether the arrival of a large firm (anchor firm) to a county generates agglomeration economies that lead to the re-homing of industries and their supply chains to those places. We match hand-collected data covering events where a large firm geographically expanded while announcing a runner-up site to restricted-use employee-employer matched U.S. Census data. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the average anchor firm leads to a reallocation from old to young firms in the winning county that account for approximately 2,300 jobs in 120 new business establishments in economically proximate and occupationally similar industries. Spillover effects appear limited with most job transitions occurring within county-industry, but along the firm age distribution.

**Abstract:** Arrivals of large plants into a county may either increase school district revenue by increasing property tax collections or reduce them through tax abatements. We analyze this relationship by comparing school districts in counties that win a plant to those in runner-up counties. We find that the arrival of a large plant increases school district property tax collections, compared to counterfactual counties, which are spent mainly on hiring new teachers. However, the gains are concentrated in districts farther away from the plant, suggesting a transfer from the district where the plant locates to adjacent districts.
