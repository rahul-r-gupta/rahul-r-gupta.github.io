["Does Goliath Help David? Anchoring Firm Creation"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9c2c2ltmxiuo25/Goliath.pdf?dl=0)
(*Working Papers 20-17, Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau*)

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the role of agglomeration economies on local firm creation after a large firm's geographical expansion (anchor firm). Using hand-collected data linked to employee-employer matched U.S. Census restricted-use microdata, we exploit anchor firms' site selection processes to employ a difference-in-differences approach to compare workers in winning counties to those in counterfactual counties. The arrival of an anchor firm induces worker reallocation towards young firms in industries related by input-output channels by a magnitude of 120 new businesses that account for approximately 2,300 jobs. Incumbent firms experiencing the fastest wage growth due to these shocks shed mid-layer employees who select into or start local young firms in connected and occupationally similar industries. These effects are strongest on workers employed in the most specialized and knowledge-intensive industries. Attracting an anchor firm to a county appears to have limited spillover effects in overall employment that are mainly driven by reorganization of incumbent firms in the anchor's input-output industries that face rising labor costs.

["The Role of Large Firm Locations in Shaping U.S. Public School Finance"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qjyg8spydxhgua5/Gupta%20Rodriguez%202022.pdf?dl=0) (*w/ [Viviana Rodriguez](https://www.vivianarodriguez.com/)*)

**Abstract:** With over a third of school district funds coming from property taxes levied on households and firms, changes to the local property tax base affect revenues and budgeting priorities for public schools. Arrivals of Million Dollar Plants (MDP) into a county may increase school district revenue by increasing property tax collections. However, because local governments offer companies tax incentives to locate facilities in their jurisdictions, the effect of the arrival of a large firm to a community on school district finance is ambiguous. We uncover this relationship by linking information of public school district finance with firm arrivals and comparing school districts in counties that win a MDP to those in counties that were considered runners-up. We find that the arrival of a MDP increases school district property tax collections, compared to counterfactual counties, which are spent mainly on hiring new teachers. Furthermore, we find that school districts where the MDP locates does not see revenue increases. Rather, the gains are concentrated in districts adjacent to the MDP's, suggesting a transfer from the district where the plant locates to adjacent school districts.
