["Does Goliath Help David? Anchoring Firm Creation"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9c2c2ltmxiuo25/Goliath.pdf?dl=0)
(*Working Papers 20-17, Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau*)

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the role of agglomeration economies on local firm creation after a large firm's geographical expansion (anchor firm). Using hand-collected data linked to employee-employer matched U.S. Census restricted-use microdata, we exploit anchor firms' site selection processes to employ a difference-in-differences approach to compare workers in winning counties to those in counterfactual counties. The arrival of an anchor firm induces worker reallocation towards young firms in industries related by input-output channels by a magnitude of 120 new businesses that account for approximately 2,300 jobs. Incumbent firms experiencing the fastest wage growth due to these shocks shed mid-layer employees who select into or start local young firms in connected and occupationally similar industries. These effects are strongest on workers employed in the most specialized and knowledge-intensive industries. Attracting an anchor firm to a county appears to have limited spillover effects in overall employment that are mainly driven by reorganization of incumbent firms in the anchor's input-output industries that face rising labor costs.

"The Role of Large Firm Locations in Shaping U.S. Public School Finance" (*w/ [Viviana Rodriguez](https://www.vivianarodriguez.com/); draft forthcoming*)

**Abstract:** Most public school districts in the United States operate as autonomous government entities with discretionary power over fundraising and expenditures. Their ability to raise revenue is largely determined by the size of the local tax base with over a third of the average school district's funds coming from property taxes levied on households and firms in the district itself. Therefore, changes to property values in a school district greatly affect revenues and budgeting priorities for public schools. Using a rich panel dataset of public school districts in the U.S. Common Core of Data (CCD), this paper investigates how shocks to local economic conditions affect public school finances by comparing school districts in counties that win a Million Dollar Plant (MDP) to those in counties that were considered runners-up. We identify that the arrival of a MDP increases school district property tax collections by over 9% per enrolled student starting two years after the MDP decision and persist for at least 7 years. School districts spend the additional revenue on hiring new teachers. Seven years after the arrival of the MDP, school districts employ 7% more teachers per pupil.
