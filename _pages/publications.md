**Abstract:** Can policymakers induce clusters using place-based business subsidies? A major development in U.S. economic policy is the use of business subsidies targeting megafirms to locate in specific locations. We study whether these targeted firms serve as anchors for industry agglomerations, lead to the re-homing of industries and  supply chains, and contribute to labor market dynamism. We construct a hand-collected data set covering events where a large firm geographically expanded while announcing a runner-up site and match to restricted employee-employer U.S. Census data. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the average anchor firm leads to a reallocation from old to young firms in the winning county that account for approximately 2,300 jobs in 120 new business establishments in economically proximate and occupationally similar industries. Spillover effects appear limited with most job transitions occurring within county-industry, but along the firm age distribution.

**Abstract:** Arrivals of large firms into a county may increase school district revenue by increasing property tax collections. However, the extensive use of targeted tax subsidies to attract such firms could potentially offset gains. We uncover this relationship by comparing school districts in counties that win a new establishment to those in runner-up counties. We find that the arrival of a large firm increases per student property tax revenue that is mainly spent on total teacher compensation. These gains are concentrated in districts farther away from the plant rather than those most proximate. Consistent with recent literature on place-based business subsidies, we show that openings associated with subsidies do not improve overall district revenue which suggests that attracting new firms to an area does not necessarily improve funding for local public goods.
